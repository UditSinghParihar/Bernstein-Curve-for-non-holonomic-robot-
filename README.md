# Bernstein-Curve-for-non-holonomic-robot-


Constraints ->
starting -> time=0, coordinates=(0,0), velocity in x and y direction=(0,0), angle=0 degree.
mid -> time=2.5, coordinates=(5,5), velocity in x and y direction=(1,sqrt(3)), angle = 30 deg.
end -> time=5, coordinates=(10,10), velocity in x and y direction=(2,2), angle = 45 deg.

It is uni-cycle model. The point touching the curve is the center of the wheel.

The data is generated by 'path.m' file into 'data' file.

Animation can be drawn directly from 'animate.m' file.
